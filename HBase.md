# Chapter: Apache HBase Essentials

## Chapter Objectives

This chapter provides a comprehensive understanding of Apache HBase, a distributed, scalable, and column-oriented database built for Big Data applications. It walks through the limitations of traditional relational databases, the need for NoSQL solutions, HBase’s architecture, data model, operations, integration with the Hadoop ecosystem, and practical code examples in Java and Python. By the end of this chapter, readers will be able to:

- Understand the core concepts and use cases of Apache HBase
- Describe HBase’s data model and architecture
- Perform basic CRUD operations using the HBase Shell, Java, and Python
- Integrate HBase with other components in the Hadoop ecosystem
- Apply best practices for performance tuning and schema design

## 1. Introduction to Apache HBase

Apache HBase is a distributed, scalable, big data store modeled after Google's Bigtable. It is designed to provide real-time read and write access to large datasets hosted in a Hadoop environment. Unlike traditional relational databases, HBase is a non-relational, column-oriented database that runs on top of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).

HBase supports random, real-time read/write access to your data. It is capable of handling billions of rows and millions of columns, making it suitable for scenarios such as time-series data, user activity logs, and clickstream analytics.

**Key Characteristics:**

- Column-family-oriented
- Horizontally scalable
- Schema-less (except for column families)
- Supports versioned storage of data
- Tight integration with Hadoop and HDFS

**Real-World Use Cases:**

- Facebook Messages backend storage
- Adobe and Yahoo! log data storage
- Flipkart for scalable user analytics

## 2. Why Not Use Traditional RDBMS?

### 2.1 Rigid Schema
RDBMS require a fixed schema. Altering table structures is difficult in evolving Big Data environments.

### 2.2 Join Dependency
Normalized schemas increase join operations, which are expensive in large-scale systems.

### 2.3 Vertical Scaling
RDBMS traditionally scale up by adding resources to a single server. This approach is costly and limited.

### 2.4 Concurrency Overhead
Concurrency and consistency mechanisms slow down performance under heavy loads.

---

## 3. Why HBase and NoSQL?

### 3.1 Need for Flexibility and Scale
HBase is a NoSQL database offering high throughput, flexible schema, and linear horizontal scalability.

### 3.2 Use Case Fit
Perfect for time-series data, clickstream logs, and large semi-structured datasets.

## 4. HBase vs RDBMS: Key Differences

| Feature       | RDBMS        | HBase                        |
|---------------|--------------|------------------------------|
| Schema        | Fixed        | Flexible (column families)   |
| Scaling       | Vertical     | Horizontal                   |
| Joins         | Required     | Not supported                |
| ACID          | Full         | Limited (eventual consistency) |
| Data Type     | Typed        | Byte arrays                  |
| Storage       | Row-oriented | Column-family-oriented       |

## 5. HBase Data Model in Detail

### Table, Row, Column Family, Column Qualifier

- **Table**: Collection of rows
- **RowKey**: Unique ID for each row
- **Column Family**: Logical group of columns stored together
- **Column Qualifier**: Actual column name inside a column family
- **Cell**: Value at intersection of row and column qualifier
- **Timestamp**: Supports versioning of data

### Example Structure
```
Table: User
RowKey: user123
Column Family: profile
Column Qualifiers: name, email, phone
Timestamps: each write gets a timestamp
```

---

## 6. HBase Shell Operations

```bash
# Create a Table
create 'User', 'profile'

# Insert (Put) Data
put 'User', 'user123', 'profile:name', 'Alice'

# Read (Get) Data
get 'User', 'user123', 'profile:name'

# Delete Data
delete 'User', 'user123', 'profile:name'

# Scan Table
scan 'User'
```

## 7. HBase Architecture Overview

### Key Components

| Component     | Role                                           |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------|
| HMaster       | Assigns regions, manages schema                |
| RegionServer  | Serves read/write operations for data regions  |
| ZooKeeper     | Coordinates and tracks distributed state       |
| HDFS          | Stores HFiles and WAL logs                     |

### Internal Components of RegionServer

- **WAL**: Write-Ahead Log for durability
- **MemStore**: In-memory store before flushing to disk
- **HFiles**: On-disk, sorted data storage
- **BlockCache**: Caches frequently read data

---

## 8. Read and Write Paths

### Write Path
1. Client sends a `Put`
2. Data is written to the WAL
3. Data is stored in MemStore
4. Flushed to HFile when MemStore is full

### Read Path
1. Client sends a `Get`
2. RegionServer checks BlockCache
3. If not found, looks in MemStore
4. Else, reads from HFile

---

## 9. Region Splitting and Compaction

- **Minor Compaction**: Merges small HFiles to reduce lookup time
- **Major Compaction**: Merges all HFiles and removes deleted entries
- **Region Splitting**: Triggers when region exceeds size threshold

---

## 10. META Table and ZooKeeper

- **.META. Table**: Special table mapping regions to RegionServers
- **ZooKeeper**: Stores .META. table location, coordinates failover

---

## 11. Integration with Hadoop Ecosystem

### Hive Integration
```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE hbase_user(
  key STRING,
  name STRING,
  email STRING
)
STORED BY 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.hbase.HBaseStorageHandler'
WITH SERDEPROPERTIES (
  "hbase.columns.mapping" = ":key,profile:name,profile:email"
)
TBLPROPERTIES("hbase.table.name" = "User");
```

---

## 12. HBase Client API Code Examples

### Java API

```java
Configuration config = HBaseConfiguration.create();
Connection connection = ConnectionFactory.createConnection(config);
Table table = connection.getTable(TableName.valueOf("User"));

// Insert
Put put = new Put(Bytes.toBytes("user123"));
put.addColumn(Bytes.toBytes("profile"), Bytes.toBytes("name"), Bytes.toBytes("Alice"));
table.put(put);

// Get
Get get = new Get(Bytes.toBytes("user123"));
Result result = table.get(get);
byte[] value = result.getValue(Bytes.toBytes("profile"), Bytes.toBytes("name"));
System.out.println("Value: " + Bytes.toString(value));

// Delete
Delete delete = new Delete(Bytes.toBytes("user123"));
delete.addColumns(Bytes.toBytes("profile"), Bytes.toBytes("email"));
table.delete(delete);

table.close();
connection.close();
```

### Python (HappyBase)

```python
import happybase
connection = happybase.Connection('localhost')
table = connection.table('User')

# Insert
table.put(b'user123', {b'profile:name': b'Alice', b'profile:email': b'alice@example.com'})

# Get
row = table.row(b'user123')
print(row[b'profile:name'])

# Delete
table.delete(b'user123', columns=[b'profile:email'])
```

## 13. Performance Tuning and Best Practices

### Tuning

- Use salting or hashing on RowKeys to avoid hot-spotting
- Limit the number of column families
- Use compression (e.g., Snappy, GZIP)
- Tune region size between 256MB and 10GB
- Configure BlockCache size for reads

### Best Practices

- Enable WAL for durability
- Batch puts/deletes
- Pre-split tables for parallelism
- Monitor compaction and flushing rates

## 14. Visual Architecture Overview (To Be Illustrated)

- **Diagram 1**: HBase Cluster (Client → ZooKeeper, HMaster, RegionServer, HDFS)
- **Diagram 2**: Write Path (Put → WAL → MemStore → HFile)
- **Diagram 3**: Read Path (Get → BlockCache → MemStore → HFile)
