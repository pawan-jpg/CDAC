## Vectors and Basic Data Structures

Vectors are the simplest data structures in R. They hold elements of the same type—from integers to characters.

```r
# Create an integer vector with explicit integer literals using 'L'
vect <- c(1L, 3L, 5L, 8L)
print(vect)            # Displays: 1 3 5 8
print(class(vect))     # Returns the type, e.g., "integer"
print(as.numeric(vect))  # Converts integer values to numeric (double precision)
```

**Deep Dive:**  
- **Type Coercion:** Functions like `as.numeric()` are helpful when you need to convert between data types. Remember that R follows a coercion hierarchy (logical < integer < numeric < complex < character).
- **Efficiency:** Vectors are stored contiguously in memory, making operations on them fast. Always verify the type if you plan on heavy numerical computations.

---

## Lists and Nested Data Structures

Lists allow you to store items of different types (including other lists), making them ideal for complex data organization.

```r
# Simple list structure
l <- list("a", 1L, 1.5, TRUE)
str(l)  # Displays the internal structure of the list

# Nested lists
d <- list(
  list("a", 1L, 1.5, TRUE),
  list(1L, 3L, 5L, 8L)
)
print(d)

# Named list for key-value pairs
city <- list("MH" = 1, "MP" = 2, "CH" = 3)
print(city)
```

**Deep Dive:**  
- **Flexibility:** Lists can contain vectors, data frames, or even other lists. This is particularly useful when storing hierarchical data or returning multiple objects from functions.
- **Naming Elements:** Naming allows you to access elements with `city$MH` instead of using numeric indices, boosting code readability.

## Installing and Loading Packages

Installing and loading packages can extend R's functionality instantly.

```r
# Installing packages (only need to do this once per package)
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("devtools")

# Loading packages into your current session with library()
library(tidyverse)   # A suite of packages for data science tasks (dplyr, ggplot2, etc.)
library(lubridate)   # For simpler date and time manipulation
```

**Deep Dive:**  
- **Package Management:** Use `update.packages()` periodically to keep your packages up-to-date. When collaborating, consider using a project management tool like `renv` or `packrat` to ensure reproducibility.
- **Tidyverse:** This ecosystem is designed for readability and efficiency, streamlining data manipulation and visualization.

---

## Date and Time Functions Using Lubridate

Manipulating dates and times is made easy with the `lubridate` package.

```r
# Get current date and time
print(today())  # Current date
print(now())    # Current date and time

# Converting strings to date objects using ymd (Year-Month-Day)
dd <- ymd("2023-01-20")
print(class(dd))  # Should return "Date"

# Interpreting numeric input as a date (YYYYMMDD format)
print(ymd(20250409))

# Converting current time to a full datetime format then stripping time information
oops <- ymd_hms(now())
print(as_date(oops))
```

**Deep Dive:**  
- **Parsing Dates:** Functions like `ymd()`, `mdy()`, `dmy()` save time, as you don’t need to specify the format manually.
- **Handling Time Zones:** For global applications, consider using timezone specifications with `with_tz()` to avoid computation mistakes.

## Matrices, Arrays, and Data Frames

### Matrices

Matrices are 2-dimensional collections that store elements of the same type.

```r
a <- 1:5
b <- 46:50

# Column-wise binding: each vector becomes a column.
m1 <- cbind(a, b)
print(m1)

# Row-wise binding: each vector becomes a row.
m2 <- rbind(a, b)
print(m2)

# View the dimensions: rows x columns
print(dim(m1))
print(dim(m2))
```

**Deep Dive (Matrices):**  
- **Recycling Rule:** When performing arithmetic with vectors of different lengths, R “recycles” the shorter vector. Always check that the longer vector’s length is a multiple of the shorter to avoid unintended results.

### Arrays

Arrays can have more than two dimensions—it’s an extension of matrices.

```r
# Create a simple one-dimensional array with 3 elements.
h <- array(dim = c(3))
h[1] <- 3
h[2] <- 55
h[3] <- 90
print(h)
```

**Deep Dive (Arrays):**  
- **Multiple Dimensions:** Arrays are particularly useful for representing multi-dimensional data, such as in image processing or time-series across multiple dimensions.

### Data Frames

Data frames are tabular data structures where each column can be of a different type.

```r
a <- c("A", "B", "C")
b <- c(6, 5, 4)
df <- data.frame(a, b)
print(df)
# In RStudio use View(df) to see a spreadsheet-like view.
```

**Deep Dive (Data Frames):**  
- **Column Names:** Use `names(df)` and `colnames(df)` to check or modify column names. Ensuring that your data frame has meaningful column names improves analysis and sharing.
- **Factor Variables:** Converting character vectors to factors (using `stringsAsFactors = TRUE` or `factor()`) is essential when dealing with categorical data.

## File Input/Output Operations

### Reading CSV Files

```r
# Specify the full path or change your working directory using setwd()
c2018 <- read.csv("E:/datasetscars2018.csv")
View(c2018)

boston <- read.csv("E:/Pawan/CAP_May24-main_R_Data/Datasets/Datasets/boston.csv")
View(boston)

# Check unique values in a column
print(unique(c2018$Transmission))
```

**Deep Dive:**  
- **Working Directory:** Setting your working directory with `setwd()` simplifies file paths. Use `getwd()` to check your current directory.
- **Data Cleaning:** Consider exploring functions such as `na.omit()` or packages like `tidyr` to clean your data after reading it.

### Handling Files Without Headers

```r
# Reading a CSV file without headers
bolyw <- read.csv("Bollywood_2015_2.csv", header = FALSE)
View(bolyw)

# Manually set column names
colnames(bolyw) <- c("movie_name", "BO", "Budget", "verdict")
View(bolyw)
```

**Deep Dive:**  
- **Localization:** Some CSV files use semicolons (`;`) as delimiters and commas (`,`) for decimals. In such cases, use `read.csv2()` with the correct parameters.
- **Date Parsing:** After reading CSV files, you might often need to convert date columns using `as.Date()` or lubridate functions for consistency.

### Reading Excel Files

```r
library(readxl)

# Reading an entire Excel file
psr <- read_excel("pressure.xlsx")
View(psr)

# Reading a specific range and sheet from an Excel file
qal <- read_excel("quality.xlsx", range = "A1:C6", sheet = "quality")
View(qal)

# Reading another range from the same sheet
qal2 <- read_excel("quality.xlsx", range = "H1:J19", sheet = 'quality')
View(qal2)
```

**Deep Dive:**  
- **Packages:** The `readxl` package is designed to read Excel files without requiring external dependencies like Java.
- **Selective Importing:** Specifying a range or a sheet allows you to import only the data you need, which can reduce processing time for very large files.

### Exporting Data

```r
# Using an inbuilt dataset, Formaldehyde, as an example
data("Formaldehyde")
View(Formaldehyde)

# Write a CSV file with row names (default) and without row names
write.csv(Formaldehyde, "E:/datasets/psb.csv")
write.csv(Formaldehyde, "E:/datasets/pssb.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# Exporting to Excel using writexl
library(writexl)
write_xlsx(Formaldehyde, "E:/datasets/pb.xlsx")
```

**Deep Dive:**  
- **Reproducibility:** Export your cleaned or transformed data for reproducibility. Keeping a copy in a CSV or Excel format can be useful for sharing with peers who do not use R.
- **Formatting:** Removing row names is often preferred for cleaner data presentation.

## Data Subsetting and Indexing

R offers powerful methods to subset and index data, whether you are working with vectors, matrices, or data frames.

### Vectors

```r
v <- c(56, 89, 10, 90, 45, 67, 22, 30, 69)
print(v > 50)    # Logical vector: TRUE/FALSE for each element
print(v[v > 50]) # Extracts values greater than 50
```

**Deep Dive:**  
- **Conditional Subsetting:** Logical operations return a vector of boolean values that can be used directly for subsetting—a common pattern in data analysis.

### Matrices

```r
m <- matrix(1:12, 3, 4)
print(m)
print(m[, 2])   # Second column
print(m[2, ])   # Second row
print(m[3, ])   # Third row
print(m[, 3])   # Third column
print(m[2, 3])  # Element at row 2, column 3
```

**Deep Dive:**  
- **Indexing:** Matrices can be indexed using `[row, column]`. Missing an index (e.g., `m[, 2]`) selects all elements for that dimension, a common technique in data manipulation.
- **Performance:** For large numerical computations, matrices (which are stored in contiguous memory) often perform faster than data frames.

### Using the `subset()` Function with Data Frames

```r
# Assuming 'diamonds' dataset is already loaded via read.csv2("Diamonds.csv")
ss <- subset(diamonds, carat > 4)
sc <- subset(diamonds, cut == 'Ideal')
sp <- subset(diamonds, cut == 'Ideal' & price > 2000)  # Combination of conditions
View(ss)
View(sc)
View(sp)
```

**Deep Dive:**  
- **Clarity:** The `subset()` function can make your code more readable when filtering data.
- **Advanced Filtering:** You can combine conditions with logical operators (&, |) to perform complex subset operations.

---

## Control Structures: If-Else, Loops, and Functions

Control structures allow you to dictate the flow of your R scripts.

### If-Else Statements

```r
# Basic if-else example
s <- 90
if (s > 30) {
  t <- 9
  s <- 20
} else {
  t <- 16
  s <- 30
}
print(t)
print(s)
```

**Deep Dive:**  
- **Flow Control:** Use if-else statements to execute code blocks conditionally. They can be nested for more complex logic.
- **Best Practices:** Always indent code within conditions and consider formatting to enhance readability.

#### Interactive Example: Calculating Tax on Simple Interest

```r
# Prompt user for input (run in an interactive session)
p <- as.numeric(readline("Principal: "))
n <- as.numeric(readline("No. of Years: "))
t <- as.numeric(readline("Rate of Interest: "))

si <- (p * n * t) / 100  # Simple interest calculation

if (si > 50000) {
  si <- si * 0.1       # Apply a 10% tax rate if interest exceeds 50,000
}
# Methods for output formatting:
print(paste("Tax:", si))
print(sprintf("TAX: %d", si))
```

### Loops

Loops are useful for repetitive tasks. R supports both `for` and `while` loops.

#### For Loop Examples

```r
# Print numbers 1 to 10
for (i in 1:10) {
  print(i)
}

# Print the square of each number in a vector
for (i in c(3, 4, 5, 6)) {
  print(i * i)
}
```

#### Calculating Factorial with a For Loop

```r
result <- 1
for (i in 1:10) {
  result <- result * i
}
print(result)
print(factorial(10))  # Using R's built-in factorial function for verification
```

#### Using the `seq()` Function in Loops

```r
# Generate a sequence from 10 down to 1
print(seq(10, 1, -1))

# Loop with increasing sequence
for (i in seq(1, 10, 1)) {
  print(i)
}

# Loop with decreasing sequence using seq()
for (i in seq(10, 1, -1)) {
  print(i)
}
```

#### While Loop Examples

```r
# Count from 1 to 9
count <- 1
while (count < 10) {
  print(count)
  count <- count + 1
}

# Loop incrementing by 5 until 50 is reached
i <- 1
while (i <= 50) {
  print(i)
  i <- i + 5
}
```

#### Using NEXT and BREAK in Loops

```r
# Break out of a loop when the number exceeds 30
for (i in seq(1, 50, 5)) {
  print(i)
  if (i > 30) break
}

# Skip (using next) when i equals 3
for (i in seq(1, 4)) {
  if (i == 3) next  # Skip iteration when i is 3
  print(i)
}
```

**Deep Dive (Loops):**  
- **Vectorization:** While loops and for loops are useful, remember that R is optimized for vectorized operations, which are faster for many data manipulation tasks.
- **Readability:** Use descriptive variable names and comment your loop logic, especially in more complex workflows.

## Data Exploration and Analysis Functions

R provides several functions to quickly inspect and summarize your data.

```r
# Inspect the structure of a data frame
df <- read.csv("AutoCollision.csv")
str(df)

# Frequency counts for categorical data
print(table(df$Vehicle_Use))
print(table(df$Age))
```

### Analyzing a Survey Dataset

```r
survey <- read.csv("survey.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

# Frequency counts with NA handling
print(table(survey$Sex))
print(table(survey$Smoke, useNA = "ifany"))
print(table(survey$Exer, useNA = "ifany"))

# Cross-tabulation between variables; adds marginal totals
cross_tab <- table(survey$Smoke, survey$Exer, useNA = "ifany")
print(cross_tab)
print(addmargins(cross_tab))
```

**Deep Dive:**  
- **Missing Data:** Use attributes like `useNA = "ifany"` or `useNA = "always"` to understand the impact of missing values.
- **Summary Functions:** Consider using `summary()` on your data frames to get a quick view of statistical summaries (min, max, mean, etc.).
